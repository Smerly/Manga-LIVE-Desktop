# Manga-LIVE
 A prototype website for posting manga and collaborating with others.
 
Currently, posting features are not implemented yet, but the website is navigatable, and there is a search filter feature with iterated sample mangas. The "create" page also takes in user inputs for a filter, but the filter has not yet been implemented.
